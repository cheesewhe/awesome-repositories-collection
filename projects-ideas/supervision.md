# Supervision

**Repository:** https://github.com/roboflow/supervision

## 📋 Description

Supervision is a universal open-source Python framework for computer vision, created by SkalskiP and the Roboflow team. It provides reusable "building blocks" for most modern computer vision projects.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Model-agnostic approach** — Works with any models (YOLO, MMDetection, Transformers). You can use your own models — visualization and processing work with various frames, masks, coordinates, labels, and data.

- **High-level visualization (Annotators)**: bounding boxes, keypoints, masks, zone highlighting, labels.

- **Streaming video processing API**: Track objects in real-time, build dashboards and analytics.

- **Dataset management**: Load, save, merge, split, format data. Supports COCO, VOC, and other formats.

- **Built-in tracking and metrics** — Count unique objects, behavior analysis, statistics.

- **Extremely simple deployment**: Python ≥3.9, install via pip, rich documentation and examples.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- **Data Scientists and ML Engineers** — Quickly create visualizations or build CV service prototypes
- **CV Developers** — Integrate detectors, analyze video/images, count and track objects
- **Researchers** — Convenient tool for simultaneous testing and presentation of results
- **Data Annotators** — Tools for fast manual or automatic annotation
- **Business/Startups** — Accelerate MVP deployment for CV services (monitoring systems, video analytics, smart retail)
