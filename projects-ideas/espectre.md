## 📋 Description

Espectre is an open-source project for Wi‑Fi CSI (Channel State Information) based presence and motion detection using commodity routers. This innovative approach uses existing Wi‑Fi infrastructure to detect human presence and movement without requiring dedicated sensors or cameras. The system is privacy-focused, local-first, and integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant for smart home automation.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Wi‑Fi CSI Analysis**: Leverages Channel State Information from standard Wi‑Fi routers to detect human presence and motion
- **Privacy-First**: No cameras or dedicated sensors required — uses existing Wi‑Fi infrastructure
- **Local Processing**: All detection happens locally, ensuring complete data privacy
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Native integration with Home Assistant for smart home automation
- **Commodity Hardware**: Works with standard off-the-shelf routers — no special equipment needed
- **Real-Time Detection**: Continuous monitoring of occupancy and motion in designated areas

## 🚀 Use Cases

- **Smart Home Automation**: Automatically control lights, HVAC, and other systems based on room occupancy
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize energy consumption by detecting when rooms are unoccupied
- **Security Systems**: Enhance security monitoring without invasive cameras
- **IoT Projects**: Build presence-aware applications for home automation
- **Research & Development**: Explore Wi‑Fi CSI applications for human activity recognition

## 💡 Typical Scenarios

- Automatic lighting control when entering/exiting rooms
- HVAC optimization based on room occupancy
- Security monitoring without cameras
- Smart office space utilization tracking
- Elderly care monitoring systems
