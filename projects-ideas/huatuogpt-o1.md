# HuatuoGPT-o1 — Medical Reasoning LLM (Project Idea)

Repository: https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT-o1/

## 🧠 Description
HuatuoGPT-o1 is a medically oriented large language model aimed at high-quality clinical reasoning. Use it as a base for building healthcare assistants with step-by-step reasoning grounded in clinical guidelines and literature.

## ✨ Idea Directions
- Clinical Q&A assistant with transparent reasoning traces
- Triage and symptom checker with risk flags and follow-up questions
- SOAP note generator from structured/unstructured inputs
- Medication interaction checker with guideline citations
- Differential diagnosis brainstorming tool with exclusion criteria

## 🔑 Key Features (to build)
- Structured chain-of-thought and decision justifications
- Grounded retrieval from guidelines (UpToDate-like flow with local docs)
- Safety guardrails: disclaimers, scope limits, hallucination detectors
- Audit logs of prompts, evidence, and outputs for clinical review

## 🧪 Use Cases
- Resident training simulator (case-based reasoning with feedback)
- Clinic intake assistant (pre-visit information collection and summaries)
- Research assistant for literature triage and evidence mapping

## ⚙️ Setup (example)
1. Provision an LLM runtime (local or hosted).
2. Build a RAG pipeline with curated medical guidelines and textbooks.
3. Implement a reasoning scaffold (multi-stage prompts; self-checks).
4. Add UI (Web/Widget) with risk disclaimers and export to PDF/EMR.
